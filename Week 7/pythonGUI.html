        <h2>Python GUI Programming With Tkinter</h2>
        <p>
            Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard
            library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and
            Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with
            Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.

        <h3>Building Your First Python GUI Application With Tkinter</h3>
        <p>
            The foundational element of a Tkinter GUI is the window. Windows are the containers in which all other
            GUI elements live. These other GUI elements, such as text boxes, labels, and buttons, are known as
            widgets. Widgets are contained inside of windows.

        <h3>Adding a Widget</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you have a window, you can add a widget. Use the tk.Label class to add some text to a window.
            Create a Label widget with the text "Hello, Tkinter" and assign it to a variable called greeting.
        </p>

        <h3>Working With Widgets</h3>
        <p>
            Widgets are the bread and butter of the Python GUI framework Tkinter. They are the elements through which
            users interact with your program. Each widget in Tkinter is defined by a class.

        <h3>Displaying Text and Images With Label Widgets</h3>
        <p>
            Label widgets are used to display text or images. The text displayed by a Label widget can’t be edited by
            the user. It’s for display purposes only. As you saw in the example at the beginning of this tutorial,
            you can create a Label widget by instantiating the Label class and passing a string to the text parameter.
